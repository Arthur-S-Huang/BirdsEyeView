# Set up Swift & Xcode

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc.
Xcode is an IDE for building apps on Mac, iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products. We will use this tool
for development. To install, click [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835).

You should already have Swift on your device. The Xcode website states: "Swift 5 is now built right into all Apple platforms and the binary interface for Swift is stable moving forward."
Run `swift -v` in command prompt to inspect the current version of Swift on your device, if it's not installed, run `swift`, and agree to terms of service. If the interactive shell REPL is launched, press `control + d` to exit.

# Hello, World!

Run `cd` to change into the current directory of your cloned, local repository. Run `swift hello.swift`. This is a simple program that prints one line of text!

To create your first simple Swift program using Xcode, first launch the tool. Then click on file, select new file. Now, choose Swift File. Select a folder to store this file you just created. Once the text editor opens, write `print("")`. The argument can be whatever you want. Then press `control + s` to save this file.

After you completed your first simple Swift program, navigate to the directory in which you created the file. Run `swift <name-of-your-file>.swift`.
